### Companion mod: High-resolution UI

Even though the game officially supports higher resolutions, most of these images were not updated and can look very blurry, so I created a mod to replace most of the user interface and fullscreen images with high-resolution counterparts.

It can be found on Nexus Mods: [High-resolution UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodrayneterminalcut/mods/9)
